# MP2: Distributed Group Membership

## Design
This program implements a heartbeat-based membership protocol with failure detection. The N processes in the system are arranged in a pseudo-ring topology which is updated every time a process joins/leaves/exits the system. The system consists of four components running simultaneously/continuously â€“ client, server, failure detector and heartbeat handler. 
One chosen server acts as the introducer node which is responsible for allowing new processes to join the membership system. No other process is allowed to join the system when the introducer is down. When the introducer is back up, all existing processes automatically rejoin the system.
Failure detector detects a process as failed if it does not receive a heartbeat in the last 1 second and removes the process from the membership list if heartbeat is not received for 2 seconds.
Whenever a failure is detected, all membership lists are updated within 2-3 seconds, thus maintaining time-bound completeness.
Each system sends its heartbeat to 1 predecessor and 2 successor nodes every 500 milliseconds. 
Since it is guaranteed that there cannot be more than 3 simultaneous failures, the system ensures completeness.
The client thread expects various inputs from the user to join, leave, exit system, and print useful information such as nodeId, membershipList, etc.


## Dependencies
1. Maven - To install maven, run `sudo yum install maven` in the VM

## To run the program
1. ssh into each machine `ssh <netid>@fa19-cs425-g59-XX.cs.illinois.edu`
2. clone the git repository containing the project and navigate to `Mp2` folder
3. Run `mvn clean install` to install dependencies
4. Run `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"` to start the Main thread 
5. When the terminal shows `Waiting for user input..`, you can enter commands: `join`, `leave`, `printlist`, `printId`, `exit`. 
6. All the processes, starting with the introducer, need to `join` the system before other commands can be used
6. Use the above mentioned print options to see the updated lists.

### Notes
1. There is no separate command to run the introducer. Any one VM can be chosen as the introducer and its IPAddress has to be updated in the `Introducer.java` enum
2. To update the time duration for failure detection, the corresponding value can be updated in the `FailureDuration.java` enum
3. Every time any of these files are changed, run `mvn clean install` and `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"`
